# LuaZmachine
a Z-code interpreter being written in Lua

## What?
The project shown here is my on-again-off-again personal interest project of trying to create a Lua program for interpreting Z-code story files, such as those from Infocom's classic text adventures.

## Why?
Two main reasons:
  1. I wanted to teach myself more about how the Z-machine operate.
  2. I wanted to play Zork via the Lua-driven text terminals offered by a couple of Minecraft mods.

## Where are you drawing the technical specs from?
I've been referring to the February 2014 revision of the [Z-Machine Standards Document version 1.1](https://inform-fiction.org/zmachine/standards/z1point1/).  
I'm also looking to support the [Quetzal save format](https://inform-fiction.org/zmachine/standards/quetzal/), because interoperability is always a good idea.

## How do I run this?
Despite many years having passed between now and when I first started on this, it's nowhere near ready to run anything.  
That's mostly due to having forgotten and set aside the project a number of times, rather than an inherent, glacial slowness to my process.
